Introduction
Good Morning Sir! I am Devansh Agarwal, currently Final year student enrolled in Computer Engineering at Thapar. I am a software enthusiast with hands-on experience in developing innovative solutions through projects. Currently I am interested in the new innovations in the field of AI and Deep learning, and being moved by this, I am currently working on a deep learning project called Hemlock which protects digital arts from being copied by AI models. Apart from academic stuff, in my free time, I enjoy playing piano and guitar. Further, my aim is to apply my skills to work on real-world problems.
